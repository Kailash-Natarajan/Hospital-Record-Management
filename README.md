# Hospital-Record-Management

This project is Hospital Record Management using C++. It is a record management system built using C++. The records are stored in Data Structures.

This project contains a menu-driven UI. There are two sections, namely, (i) Patient and (ii) Employee . Each section contains records for three fields: (i) ID, (ii) Name and (iii) Age. More fields can be added, but for demonstration purposes, this project was limited to three fields. 

The Patient section contains functions and operations that will be performed on the patient records. Similarly for Employee section. The records are stored on Linked List and Binary Trees (both used for searching). The Linked List is ordered by the ID of the record. The Binary Tree is ordered by the Name field contained in the record.
